            />

            <p>I have been a little disappointed as I did not keep up my promise of writing a blog post every week. It has been a couple of months since I have written anything whatsoever. However, in my defense, I went back home to India for winter break. And, since I do not get to see my family and friends for months, I decided to take it easy and rejuvenate for my last semester at USC!</p>

            <p>As Google+ becomes a part of Google's graveyard, I decided to write about some Google products and why they died or are in the process of being shut down. The list is huge, so I will stick to a few products.</p>

            <p><b><u>Google+</u> (2011-2019)</b><br/>

            For those of you who don't know what Google+ is, Google+ is Google's fourth foray into social networking. I personally never used Google+ as I believed it lacked a social element compared to Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram. I also always believed that Google+ was too formal a platform to be a social network.
            </p>

            <p>So, it makes sense that in October 2018, Google announced that it was shutting down Google+ for consumers, citing low user engagement and a software bug.</p>

            <p>This bug exposed private information of roughly 52 million users to third-party app developers. The data breach took place the day before Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai testified before the Congress for the first time.</p>

            <p><b><u>Google URL Shortner</u> (2009-2019)</b><br/>
                
            Google URL Shortener, or <b>goo.gl</b>, is a URL shortening service. It was over 9 years old.</p>
                
            <p>The service has not been accepting new users since April 13, 2018 and will discontinue the service for existing users on March 30, 2019. After March 30, 2019, all links will continue to redirect to the intended destination.</p>

            <p><b><u>Google Spaces</u> (2016-2017)</b><br/>
            Google Spaces was an app for group discussions.</p>

            <p>Google’s traditional Spring cleaning — and with it maybe the company is showing it can be a little more focused on its messaging strategy.</p>

            <p><b><u>Google Talk</u> (2005-2017)</b><br/>
            Google Talk was an instant messaging service.</p>

            <p>Google announced its decision to discontinue Google Talk. Instead, users have been advised to start using the Hangouts app.</p>

            <p><b><u>Upcoming Obituaries</u></b><br/>
            In case you wanted to know what other services are in the process of being shut down, below you can find a brief overview.</p>

            <p><b><u>Inbox by Gmail</u> (March 2019)</b><br/>
            Inbox by Gmail aimed to improve email through several key features. It was almost 4 years old.</p>

            <p><b><u>Google Allo</u> (March 2019)</b><br/>
            Google Allo is an instant messaging mobile app by Google. It will be rebranded as Google Chat.</p>
