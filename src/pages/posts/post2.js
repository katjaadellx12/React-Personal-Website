        Why would Amazon create a contest between cities for its new
        "headquarter", and elongate it over a year?
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, in a nutshell, it creates a bidding war. Cities, attracted by the
        massive jobs and prestige that Amazon brings, would give a hand and limb
        to have Amazon. Amazon is being offered tax cuts, subsidies, and many
        more benefits. Cities are lining up with offers, and Amazon can pick the
        best.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, it was recently disclosed that Amazon would be expanding
        to two locations (and not one), defeating the entire purpose of creating
        a bidders market.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, why would Amazon spend more than a year doing this, given it is not
        that difficult to choose?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>
          <i>The answer likely lies in lucrative city data.</i>
        </b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Apart from the incentives, Amazon is getting to see detailed, private
        city plans that show how cities will be in the future. Where people will
        stay, how many people are expected to come in, and much more. As a
        retailer, which thrives off customer behaviour and real estate data,
        this is an absolute gold mine. Knowing where people will stay and where
        they will buy is an unfair advantage for planning delivery operations
        (warehouses) and retail locations (Go, Whole Foods).

      <p>This is simply genius!</p>
