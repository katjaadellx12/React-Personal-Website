            <p>Hey, everyone! I have actively been interviewing for full-time roles as a product manager. And, every interview that I have had so far has asked me about my favorite product. What follows is the question regarding what I like about it, and what changes would I bring to the table.</p>
            
            <p>So, I thought of writing this blog post sharing my favorite product. I believe that I am in no position of giving any advice as of yet, given that I have not amassed sufficient industry experience as a product manager. But, I wanted to share my favorite product nonetheless.</p>
            
            <p>One of my favorite products is Snapchat, and it has been even before it became a mainstream product.</p>
            
            <p>I think that we all agree that communication in-person is much different from communication online. And, it’s not just about being able to read people’s tone, it’s beyond that. </p>
            
            <p>People in-person are not as sensitive about how they look, or what they say because there is a presumption that nobody is recording them. Anything one does is temporary and goes away, making people much less self-conscious.</p>
            
            <p>As soon as stuff goes on to text message or starts explicitly getting  recorded, people change how they act.</p>
            
            <p>Snapchat did a much better job of really replicating some characteristics of in-person interaction because it’s inherently ephemeral. That is, anything you do, goes away.</p>
            
            <p>Since it’s temporary, people start getting much less sensitive and tend to use the product as their primary means of communication with friends.</p>
            
            <p>Let me know your thoughts as well as if you would add any features to help replicate more characteristics of in-person communication.</p>
            
            <p><b><u>Fun fact</u></b>: I recently met with Nick Bell, the vice president of Snapchat! When I asked him about Snap Inc.'s mission statement, he told me that he and his team were still figuring out the product. Because of this, I believe that Snap suffered a massive hit with a decline in customers after its redesign.  </p>
            
            <p>A company's mission statement, or even more importantly, its core belief - the value it adds to the world that differentiates it from other companies - is one of the most important things to realize.</p>
            
            <p>The <i><b>"why"</b></i> of a company is what people care about and buy into. I firmly believe that from a product point of view, that why is your guiding light; it will help you figure out what fits with the company's reason to exist and what doesn't.</p>
            
            <p>"Why" is at the core of the Golden Circle because it's the most fundamental thing you need to understand about a company. That is, everything a company does, from the products it builds to the feature decisions it makes for those products, should emerge from that value.</p>
